<h2 id="about">About The Project</h2>

Terasologyâ€™s basic engine can be extended by a huge amount (201 right now!) of modules. Keeping track of them is not the easiest task. This is why this gatsby framework provides an automated generator for a website, listing all of them. This showcase website will increase discoverability by allowing to filter and search for modules by keywords and categories.
